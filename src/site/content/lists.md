title: Lists
intro: When we need to list items, there are a few options in HTML.
---

## Unordered lists

These are lists where the order is arbitrary, for example colours:

- Red
- Blue
- Yellow
- Green

## Ordered lists

These are lists where the order affects the meaning, such as the days of the week:

1. Monday
2. Tuesday
3. Wednesday
4. Thursday
5. Friday
6. Saturday
7. Sunday

Ordered lists can be reversed, such as a countdown:

<ol reversed>
    <li>Bronze</li>
    <li>Silver</li>
    <li>Gold</li>
</ol>

Ordered lists can also be started at a specified number:

<ol start="6">
    <li>Saturday</li>
    <li>Sunday</li>
</ol>


## Description/definition lists

These are lists that contain key-value pairs. Sometimes there can be more than one value for each key.

<dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>Jane Doe</dd>
    <dt>Age</dt>
        <dd>30</dd>
    <dt>Height</dt>
        <dd>160cm</dd>
    <dt>Eye colour</dt>
        <dd>Brown</dd>
    <dt>Favourite animal</dt>
        <dd>Dogs</dd>
        <dd>Cats</dd>
</dl>

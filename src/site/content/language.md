title: Language
intro: The language of a page, and even parts of a page, is very important to users of assistive technology like screen readers.
---

This document has a `lang="en-gb"` attribute on the `<html>` element. This ensures screen readers, search engines and other machines know what language the page is written in.

It is possible to define a passage on a page in another language using the `lang` on an element within the document.

<i>Note: the `lang` attribute does not work on a semantically meaningless elements like `<div>` or `<span>`.</i>


## Block level language

<p lang="es-es">Este texto es en Español Castellano.</p>


## Inline language

<p><em lang="fr">C’est la vie</em> say the old folks.</p>

</div>
